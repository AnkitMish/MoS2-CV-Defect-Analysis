<h3>Dataset Generation</h3>

Please follow the description under dataset generation as described here https://github.com/rajak7/VAE_Phase_Transformation

<h3>Learning Details</h3>

The Network consists of CNN Layers to train image data

The training data consists of 40K images from original fracture data and only 162 images from MoS2 simulations

During testing the network was tested on 8200 images from the original MoS2 simulations and the results are shown as reported in manuscript
